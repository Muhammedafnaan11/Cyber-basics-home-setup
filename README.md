# Cyber-basics-home-setup
This is part of my cybersecurity learning journey,documenting home network assets with sensitivity analysis

So let’s talk security.
First things first -assets. That’s where every security plan begins. Why? Because assets are what hold value for an organization — sometimes deeply valuable information. And protecting them? That’s non-negotiable.
Now, when we say asset protection, we’re actually talking about asset management. It’s not just about knowing what you own, but about understanding the risks attached to each asset. Once we identify those, the next step is building an asset inventory - a clean list of what we have.
But we don’t stop there.
We go ahead and classify the assets:
Public - meant for everyone
Internal Only -kept within the org
Confidential -accessible only to people working on specific projects
Restricted - extremely sensitive, tight access only
This classification is what helps build a strong foundation for a secure environment -because not every asset needs the same level of protection, and not everyone should have access to everything.
That’s where real security begins
now lets bump into this small practical acctivity demonstration about asset management so you could be familiar with!

i have done a small activity to explain the concept of asset management through asset inventory and classification.i have taken few  of my home devices into consideration to explain this small topic
